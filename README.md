# Emojis

Click, Click. It's emoji ðŸ˜Š

A very simple, light-weighted straightforward script that add emoji picker to your bc. Very simple thing but you should have it!

## TamperMonkey install:
https://ayako-qt.github.io/Emojis/emojiTMLoader.user.js

meanwhile keep adding more emojis (thanks to my Qts)
send me any emoji you want to add, i'll add them so that all users can use them ^_^

After installing, you should see a little icon with a ðŸ˜Š floarting above your chatting input area, to the right.

## issues:
if you saw some emoji can show up correctly, probably because of lacking of certain char-set in your device, different people will see different glitches
please use the one that you can see it displaying correctly! 

## Next step:
make the emoji picker also work with beep menu.

holding certain keys enter "multi select" mode
