Date: [REDACTED]
Location: ███████ Rainforest, 50km northeast of [REDACTED]
Personnel Involved: MTF Nu-7 ("Hammer Down"), Bio-Research Team 66 ("Green Thumbs")

Background:
Local reports described a "walking thicket" and mass disappearances in ███████ Village. Satellite imagery revealed anomalous vegetation overgrowth (300% density increase) centered on a 1km² zone. Civilian witnesses described victims "swallowed by vines" that moved independently. Foundation embedded agents confirmed paranormal activity and deployed Nu-7.

Phase 1: Reconnaissance
Casualties: 2 Nu-7 scouts (KIA via rapid-onset strangulation by SCP-64902-1).
Findings:

Target (later designated SCP-64902) occupied a derelict temple complex, now overgrown with genetically aberrant flora.

37 humanoid figures (future SCP-64902-2 instances) tended to the area, moving in synchronized patterns.

SCP-64902 observed "pruning" a restrained human subject with ritualistic precision, laughing in Language-█████.

Noted Abilities:

Instantaneous vine generation from dead wood (hostile engagement within 3 seconds of exposure).

Telepathic coordination of SCP-64902-2 instances (no observable delay in response time).

Phase 2: Engagement
Strike Team Composition:

12 Nu-7 operatives (flamethrowers, Agent Orange sprayers).

2 researchers (remote biometric tracking).

Timeline:

00:00: Nu-7 breached the temple perimeter. SCP-64902-2 instances reacted with unnatural speed, forming a defensive line.

00:02: SCP-64902 vocalized a command; vines erupted from the temple walls, incapacitating Operative █████ via femur fracture.

00:04: Defoliant deployment suppressed 60% of SCP-64902-1 instances. SCP-64902 entered dormant state upon direct flame exposure.

00:07: Remaining SCP-64902-2 instances desiccated without SCP-64902’s sustained telepathy.

Casualties:

4 Nu-7 KIA (vine-based trauma, 1 via enzymatic digestion).

11 SCP-64902-2 instances terminated (incineration).

Phase 3: Extraction
Containment Protocol:

SCP-64902 transported in a hermetically sealed, soil-free crate lined with Agent Wilt dispensers.

All residual plant matter within 200m scorched via napalm.

Post-Incident Analysis:

Recovered SCP-64902-2 tissue samples revealed chloroplast integration akin to Ophiocordyceps-level parasitism.

Temple carvings depicted a similar entity worshipped as a "Garden’s Maw," suggesting historical activity.

O5 Directive:
"All research must prioritize suppressing its vocalization capacity. That laugh is worse than the vines."

Addendum: Survivor Testimony (D-2091, pre-conversion)
"It wasn’t attacking us. It was gardening us. The vines pinned me down, and it just… patted my cheek. Said something old. Then the pain started, but I couldn’t scream. By the end, I wanted to be roots."`
